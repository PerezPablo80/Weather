# Weather App to show usage.

I use vite tool for creating a React js app.

## Steps for  creation
1. `npm create vite@latest <appName>`
2. Select React
3. Select Js
In my case the appName i place weather.

## To run it:
1. cd <appName>
2. npm install
3. npm run dev

## Extras
I used axios for fetching the data from de API, a public api that in my case was [open weather map](https://home.openweathermap.org/) for a rapid example.

In order to get axios used: `npm install axios`, in case you retrieve this git, when you run `npm install` it will automatically install axios, but keep in mind is not incorporated in vite.

In addition to this, for making it prettier i will use bootstrap, but for the second version.
