# Weather demo

for installing it you need to execute `npm run build` and then you need to change inside dist the 

file index.html, where it says /assets/... change it to ./assets unless you are using it on the root folder.

Else it will give you an error.

If you don't put the .env file on the dist folder you will need to add the API key on WeatherV1.jsx
